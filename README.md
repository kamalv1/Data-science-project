# Stock Price Prediction Project Process

Data Collection

Acquired historical stock price datasets from the source (e.g., Corizo) during an internship.
The dataset included historical stock price data for the desired stock(s) and covered a specific timeframe (e.g., daily data for the past five years).
Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values:
Identified and addressed missing data points using strategies like forward-filling, backward-filling, or interpolation.
Feature Engineering:
Extracted relevant features from raw stock price data, potentially including moving averages, technical indicators, or domain-specific factors.
Data Scaling:
Applied scaling techniques such as normalization or standardization to ensure consistent feature ranges and prevent biases toward certain features.
Dataset Splitting

Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets.
Typically used an 80:20 or 70:30 ratio, with a significant portion (e.g., 80%) allocated for training the models, and the remainder for testing and evaluating model performance.
Model Training - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

Architecture:
Designed a suitable LSTM architecture for stock price prediction, considering factors like the number of LSTM layers, hidden units per layer, and activation functions.
Loss Function and Optimizer:
Selected appropriate loss functions (e.g., mean squared error, MSE) and optimizers (e.g., Adam or RMSprop) for training the LSTM model.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Experimented with hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs to find optimal settings for the LSTM model.
Training:
Fed the preprocessed training data into the LSTM model, performed forward and backward propagation, and iteratively updated the model's weights to minimize the chosen loss function.
Model Training - XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

Data Preparation:
Formatted the preprocessed data into the appropriate input format for XGBoost, such as a pandas DataFrame or DMatrix.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Conducted hyperparameter tuning, possibly using techniques like grid search or random search, to identify the optimal hyperparameter configuration for the XGBoost model (e.g., learning rate, maximum tree depth, number of estimators).
Training:
Trained the XGBoost model on the preprocessed training data using the selected hyperparameters.
Monitored the training progress and assessed the model's performance using evaluation metrics.
Model Evaluation

Evaluated the performance of both the LSTM and XGBoost models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or mean percentage error (MPE).
Compared the performance of the two models on the test set to assess their relative effectiveness in predicting stock prices.
Prediction

Applied the trained LSTM and XGBoost models to make predictions on new, unseen stock price data.
Analyzed the predictions and assessed their accuracy and reliability using evaluation metrics and visualizations.
