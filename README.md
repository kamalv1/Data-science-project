# Stock Price Prediction Project Process

Data Collection

Acquired historical stock price datasets from the source (e.g., Corizo) during an internship.
The dataset included historical stock price data for the desired stock(s) and covered a specific timeframe (e.g., daily data for the past five years).
Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values:
Identified and addressed missing data points using strategies like forward-filling, backward-filling, or interpolation.
Feature Engineering:
Extracted relevant features from raw stock price data, potentially including moving averages, technical indicators, or domain-specific factors.
Data Scaling:
Applied scaling techniques such as normalization or standardization to ensure consistent feature ranges and prevent biases toward certain features.
Dataset Splitting

Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets.
Typically used an 80:20 or 70:30 ratio, with a significant portion (e.g., 80%) allocated for training the models, and the remainder for testing and evaluating model performance.
Model Training - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

Architecture:
Designed a suitable LSTM architecture for stock price prediction, considering factors like the number of LSTM layers, hidden units per layer, and activation functions.
Loss Function and Optimizer:
Selected appropriate loss functions (e.g., mean squared error, MSE) and optimizers (e.g., Adam or RMSprop) for training the LSTM model.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Experimented with hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs to find optimal settings for the LSTM model.
Training:
Fed the preprocessed training data into the LSTM model, performed forward and backward propagation, and iteratively updated the model's weights to minimize the chosen loss function.
Model Training - XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

Data Preparation:
Formatted the preprocessed data into the appropriate input format for XGBoost, such as a pandas DataFrame or DMatrix.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Conducted hyperparameter tuning, possibly using techniques like grid search or random search, to identify the optimal hyperparameter configuration for the XGBoost model (e.g., learning rate, maximum tree depth, number of estimators).
Training:
Trained the XGBoost model on the preprocessed training data using the selected hyperparameters.
Monitored the training progress and assessed the model's performance using evaluation metrics.
Model Evaluation

Evaluated the performance of both the LSTM and XGBoost models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or mean percentage error (MPE).
Compared the performance of the two models on the test set to assess their relative effectiveness in predicting stock prices.
Prediction

Applied the trained LSTM and XGBoost models to make predictions on new, unseen stock price data.
Analyzed the predictions and assessed their accuracy and reliability using evaluation metrics and visualizations.
This structured process provides a clear overview of the steps involved in your stock price prediction project, from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

#Red Wine Quality Analysis Project Workflow:

Data Collection: Obtained a dataset from the internship organization containing information about red wine samples. The dataset included various attributes such as acidity levels, pH, alcohol content, and chemical properties, alongside quality ratings.

Data Preprocessing: Prepared the dataset for model training through essential preprocessing steps, including:

Handling Missing Values: Identified and addressed missing data points by employing strategies like imputation with mean or median values.
Feature Scaling: Applied feature scaling techniques (standardization or normalization) to ensure uniform feature scales and prevent biases towards specific attributes.
Feature Encoding: Transformed categorical features into numerical representations suitable for classification models if necessary.
Dataset Splitting: Divided the preprocessed dataset into training and testing subsets, often employing a 70:30 or 80:20 ratio. The majority of the data (e.g., 70%) was allocated for training, while the remainder was reserved for testing and model evaluation.

Model Training: Utilized a variety of classification models for red wine quality analysis, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLPClassifier, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

Model Configuration: Set up model configurations, including hyperparameter settings (e.g., number of neighbors for KNN or maximum depth for Decision Trees).
Model Training: Trained each classification model on the preprocessed training data, iteratively adjusting model parameters using techniques like grid search or random search for optimization.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessed model performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, enabling comparisons to determine relative performance.
Model Selection - Random Forest: Based on evaluation results, identified the Random Forest model as having the highest accuracy among the tested classification models.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuned the Random Forest model's hyperparameters to maximize performance. Conducted grid search or random search to find the best combination of hyperparameters, considering factors like the number of trees, maximum depth, and feature subset size.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the tuned Random Forest model's performance on the preprocessed testing data. Calculated evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) to assess the model's effectiveness in predicting red wine quality.

Prediction: Applied the trained and tuned Random Forest model to predict quality ratings for new, unseen red wine samples. Analyzed these predictions and assessed the model's accuracy and reliability in predicting wine quality.

Throughout the project, thorough documentation was maintained, capturing details of preprocessing steps, model configurations, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation results
